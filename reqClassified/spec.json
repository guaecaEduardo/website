Let's break down these requirements into functions and features. Here's a way to classify them based on common software development interpretations:

**Features:** Features are what the user interacts with and the capabilities they experience.

* **REQ-002: Landing Page:** The website being a landing page is a core defining feature.
* **REQ-006: Navbar:** The presence of a navbar is a user-facing feature.
* **REQ-010: Section Hero:**  The inclusion of a "Hero Section" is a visual design feature.
* **"new-" IDs related to Hero Section Content:** Requirements specifying the title, subtitle, and content of the Hero section dictate the features of this section. 
* **"new-" IDs related to Product Section:** Requirements defining the presence and content of a "Product Section" establish it as a feature.
* **"new-" IDs related to Product GREQ:** Descriptions of the GREQ product contribute to outlining its features.
* **"new-" IDs related to Footer Section:** Requirements outlining the presence and elements (logo, contact, copyright) within the footer section determine its features.

**Functions (Functional Requirements):** Functions describe how the system should behave in response to specific actions or inputs.

* **REQ-003: React 18:** Using React 18 is a technical implementation detail that dictates how the front end functions.
* **REQ-004: Node.js:** Similar to React, using Node.js specifies a functional aspect of the back end.
* **REQ-005: Google Cloud Platform Hosting:**  Hosting on GCP is a functional requirement related to deployment and infrastructure.
* **REQ-009: Navbar Navigation:** The navbar's ability to navigate to site sections is a key function.
* **"new-" IDs describing functionality (e.g., "shall exhibit", "should have"):** Requirements that explicitly state actions or behaviors, such as "shall exhibit" or "should have," fall under functional requirements. For example:
    * "Hero section shall exhibit title"
    * "The footer should have the logo of the company"

**Non-Functional Requirements:** These define the overall qualities and constraints of the system.

* **REQ-007: Navbar Logo and Name:** While the navbar is a feature, specifying the precise placement and content of the logo and company name falls under non-functional requirements related to visual design and branding.
* **REQ-008: Contact Us Button:** The requirement for a "Contact Us" button leans more towards visual design and user experience, making it a non-functional aspect.

**Other Classifications:**

* **REQ-001: AI-Generated Website (Context):** This is more of a high-level project goal or constraint rather than a specific feature or function.
* **Flexibility Requirement:** 
    * **REQ-006: Navbar:**  A "navbar" itself can be seen as a feature, but its flexibility could be considered a non-functional requirement. Does "flexibility" imply it should be responsive on different screen sizes, or easily customizable with new menu items?
* **"this_is_a" Field:**  Pay close attention to how the "this_is_a" field is used, as it provides valuable metadata for classification:
    *  **"Parameter"** seems to indicate specific data values rather than functionalities or features.

**Important Notes:**

* **Context is Key:** The classification of some requirements might shift slightly depending on the specific project context and interpretation. 
* **Clearer Requirements:** Well-written requirements with precise language minimize ambiguity and make the classification process more straightforward. Consider refining some of the requirements for better clarity.
